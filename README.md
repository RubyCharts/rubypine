# rubypine
A collection of indicators commonly written in PineScript, based on an affectionate name for a hex color, RUBY, as the original and unique stacking sequence of EMA's.
Your experience with optimization is needed and appreciated.
Over the years we have seen iterations mostly doing with colorizations and additions of indicators that highlight a variety of trader's interest and education.
The project has been open source with the exception of going closed during back-testing.
The original code or RUBY Vintage is available on TradingView.
